# Regression-in-Solid-Mechanics

Regression: the neural network predicts the values of the target features from the input features
Application: nonlinear boundary value problem in solid mechanics (Square continuum with elastoplastic material behavior subjected to deformation)
Network Architecture: Time-distributed Dense compared with CNN and RNN
